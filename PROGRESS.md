<b>Assignment</b> </br>

- Placing the orders: The robot has to navigate to the Bar, a designated location in another room where drinks are served. The 
robot must repeat each order to the Barman, clearly stating: </br></br>
(a) The person’s name, </br>
(b) The person’s chosen drink, </br>
(c) A description of unique characteristics of that person that allow the Barman to find them (e.g. gender, hair colour, 
how is dressed, etc). </br></br>
While the robot places the orders, the people in the “party room” may change their places within the party room 
(on request of the referees).</br></br>
- Missing beverage: One of the ordered drinks is not available, therefore, missing from the bar. The robot should realize 
this inconvenience and tell the Barman, providing a list of 3 alternatives considering the other drinks it needs to deliver. If
the robot can’t detect which drink is missing, the Barman will clearly state which of the beverages is not available and 
provide a list of 3 alternatives.

<b>General idea</b> </br>
1. Create a model of what the bar man knows and doesn't know
2. Make conversation in order to find out if this is correct
3. Model: drinks -> Use web to find out what cocktails are available (ingredients, procedures, connection with preferences of customers)

Find literature that explains how to build a conversation and a narrative, as well as how to connect them to a knowledge system.
